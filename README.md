<h2 align="center">About 📖</h2>
   
<p align="center">
    This was my first <a href="https://rocketseat.com.br/ignite">Flutter | Ignite</a> challenge, very simple, but it made me review several important concepts!<br>

<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯</h2>

  <p>
    As mentioned above, it was Ignite's first challenge, so it was pretty simple. Certainly the next ones will be even more challenging and will make me learn even more.<br>
    Never stop learning. The learning is continuous.
